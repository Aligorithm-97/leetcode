"""

Abstract Class : A class that can contain abstract methods and cannot be instantiated directly. It can have both abstract and regular methods.

Interface : A structure that contains only method signatures. It supports multiple inheritance.

Polymorphism : Allows the same method to behave differently. It is divided into Overriding and Overloading.

Overloading : Methods defined in the same class with the same name but different parameters.

Static arr : The problem with static array they have fixed size. Python offers dynamic arrays as default.

Linked List : Consist of nodes -> value and next -> head and tail

Doubly Linked List : extra prev node

Recurcion : Factorial , Fibonacci number : F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) -> F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

    Sorting

Insertion Sort : every time compare two element in order and swap if it is necessary. it is an iterative solution so it includes loops --> o(n'2)

Merge Sort : divide and conquer -> everytime divide the array to the half of it and sort from the smallest one --> o(nlogn)

Quick Sort : pick a pivot compare numbers with it if it is less then put it into left container etc. --> o(nlogn)

Bucket Sort : if we have small range of members like 0 to 2 -> find the element occurrences and put it in a bucket.

Binary Search : You can use it only if it is sorted. Higher or lower half.

Binary Search Tree : Sorted
